# Data Science (DS3000) Final Project - Boston Traffic Incident Analysis
The overarching objective for this project involves finding patterns in data related to traffic incidents and drawing conclusions to increase awareness about accident prevention in Boston. The goal is to develop a predictive model that ascertains the mode of transportation involved in road accidents by analyzing various contributing factors. Additionally, identifying and quantifying the factors that exert the most influence on each type of crash is crucial. The ultimate aim is to leverage these insights to enhance public safety measures by issuing targeted warnings.
